
Kobolds
Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry centurion, they pose a significant threat. 
Defensive Masters
In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary; every warrior carries a shield into battle, and soldiers defend each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold’s shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds. 
Kobold legionaries may join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before. 
Unconventional Tactics
Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn’t take them seriously. Their foes haven’t experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy mechanical dragons and flaming spike pit traps.
Tiny Dragons
Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons-and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales; as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon’s scales over several generations.
Domain Expansion
When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they become more like that dragon in more than just color. Some groups worship the dragon like a god. Others revere them as a leader or ancestor, or admire them like a really (REALLY) big brother. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon’s affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of that domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, may rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and may end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living inside a domain do influence the size and strength of the dragon’s hold on the territory. 
Kobold and Dragon Symbiosis
Most dragons are solitary creatures, but kobolds living in their domain provide both parties with clear benefits. A dragon can establish their domain over an area in half the time if they allow kobolds to settle in the area as well. Meanwhile, a kobold that spends 1 week or more living within the domain of a dragon becomes immune to the hazardous and negative effects of that domain. The kobold’s physical appearance may also change the longer they stay in the area.
Terrain Mastery
All of this – the kobolds’ innovative spirit, affinity for their terrain, group defenses, and creative tactics – makes a kobold legion the master of the area in which they live. While they employ traps and tricks of their own creations, they also know the ins and outs of nature’s traps. For example, a sagittarius might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over a frozen lake or desert sands, don’t give chase; they likely know something about these terrain hazards that you do not.
Kobold Languages
Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.
